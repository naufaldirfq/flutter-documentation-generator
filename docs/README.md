# Brick House Project Summary
## Overview
The project is a Flutter application that hosts various modules such as authentication, brick way management and expense tracking. The main goal of this app is to provide an efficient tool for managing different tasks in the construction industry by providing modularity with reusable components like widgets or services which can be easily integrated into other projects.
## Architecture 
The project follows a monolithic architecture where all modules are independent and communicate through APIs, ensuring scalability without compromising performance. The main architectural pattern used is the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design for state management in Flutter which helps to manage complex business logic with ease while keeping UI code clean from side effects of async operations like API calls or database writes/reads.
## Key Components 
- AuthModule: Handles user authentication using Firebase Authentication and provides services such as signup, login etc., based on the requirement in each module. It uses Flutter's package `cloud_firestore` for storing data into a NoSQL database (FireStore). The dependencies include 'auth', which is used to handle all of our user authentication needs including handling Firebase Cloud Messaging and managing users sessions, while other packages like firebase_core are necessary tools that help with initializing the app.
- BrickWay: This module manages different types of bricks (like concrete or steel) in a brick house by providing services such as adding new brics to inventory etc., based on user requirements and constraints from each project's needs, it uses Flutter packages like `flutter_svg` for handling SVG files.
- ExpenseManagementModule: Manages the expense tracking system within an organization where users can track their expenses by creating invoices or receipts with details such as date of payment/due dates etc., based on user requirements and constraints from each project's needs, it uses Flutter packages like `flutter_svg` for handling SVG files.
- TalentaModule: Manages the shift scheduling in a construction company by providing services to create shifts (starting & ending times), allocate workers accordingly etc., based on user requirements and constraints from each project's needs, it uses Flutter packages like `flutter_svg` for handling SVG files.
- Other modules can be further divided into smaller submodules as per the requirement of a larger application or module in itself to provide more specific functionalities such as payment gateway integration etc., which are not included here due their complexity and size, but they're essential parts that make up this project overall structure for managing different tasks within construction industry.
## Dependencies 
- Flutter SDK: The main dependency is the 'flutter', a package used to create native mobile applications using Dart language which runs on all platforms supported by Google (Web, Android and iOS). Other dependencies include `cloud_firestore` for Firebase database operations like CRUD operation or data storage.
- External Packages/Libraries: The project also uses external packages such as 'flutter_svg' to handle SVG files which are used in the application but not included here due their size and complexity, they can be found on pub.dev for easy use of them within your Flutter projects or you could add these dependencies manually into `pubspec.yaml` file if needed by yourself as per project requirements.
## Getting Started 
To run this app:  
1- Clone the repository to local machine using command line tool like git, then navigate inside it with terminal and type 'flutter pub get' for getting all dependencies in your Flutter environment (make sure you have flutter SDK installed). Then use `flutter run` or simply double click on .dart file name if setup correctly.
2- For detailed instructions of how to set up the project, please refer back at Git history section as it contains a list of contributors and their contribution dates for this specific repository version (Brick House Project). 
Please note that you need internet connection while running these commands or using flutter run command in order to access all dependencies. Also remember Flutter uses Dart language, so make sure your machine has installed the latest stable release from its official site and also have a good knowledge of it for better understanding about this project's architecture pattern used here (Monolithic).
