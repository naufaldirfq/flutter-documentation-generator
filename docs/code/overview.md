# Brick House Project Overview Documentation (0.1.0) #
## Introduction to The Project ##  
The brick_house Flutter Main Module for Bricks is an application that hosts various modules such as auth, brisk-way, expense management and talenta module which are all written in Dart language using the flutter framework with a specific version of yaml library. 

## System Architecture ##  
The architecture consists mainly around modularity where each component has its own responsibility within an application context such as authentication (auth_module), brick way(brick-way) and expense management module, talenta modules etc., all are independent components that interact with the main app. 

## Design Patterns ##  
The project uses a modular approach where each component is designed to have its own responsibility within an application context such as authentication (auth_module), brick way(brick-way) and expense management module, talenta modules etc., all are independent components that interact with the main app. 

## Module Organization ##  
The project follows a modular approach where each component is designed to have its own responsibility within an application context such as authentication (auth_module), brick way(brick-way) and expense management module, talenta modules etc., all are independent components that interact with the main app. 

## Key Components ##  
The project consists of several key elements: AuthModule for handling user authorization related tasks; BriskWay Module to handle brick way operations such as creating bricks and managing them in a database, ExpenseManagement module handles all expenses management including tracking transactions with users etc., Talenta modules are responsible for various functionalities like shift scheduling or talent matching.
  
## Interaction ## 
The components interact through the use of Dart classes that encapsulate business logic within their respective packages and expose APIs to be consumed by other parts in an application context such as authentication (auth_module), brick way(brick-way) etc., all are independent modules. The main app is responsible for orchestrating these interactions based on the user's request, handling data persistence if required using databases and managing state with Redux/MobX in a more scalable manner as per requirement of larger applications like brick_house project.
